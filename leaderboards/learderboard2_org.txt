We introduce deformable convolution and dilate convolution in the basic model to make it more powerful in detecting small targets.During training, we set the scale of the input image to [1024,1024] and use warm-up strategy in the learning rate adjustment phase.During testing, we split all the test images into [1024,1024] and then merge the results by using post-possessing method: NMS.It is noticable that we use different nms threholds for different categories to get better results, and we call it :multi_nms.",

            "description": "This method is obtained by improving the Faster RCNN. In order to enable the model to detect targets of different sizes, this method uses 27 different anchors with 9 different sizes (32,96,128,192,384,512,768,1536,3072) and 3 scales (1:1, 1:2, 2:1). When training the data, the reverse sequence method is used to cut the pictures on the edge to make full use of the training data set. The same method is used when testing the data to reduce missed detections. When testing the data, the images are cut by overlapping between the pictures, missed detections caused by dividing the same target into two pictures are reduced in this way. For the initial detection results, the non_maximum suppression method with a threshold of 0.5 is used to screen the results and get the final result.",

            "description": "These predictions have been made by a simple Faster-RCNN model with a classifier that predicts the whole 15 classes (not a one versus all method).\r\nThe dataset has been standardized so that each image has the same size as the others (512x512). Thus I can control model inputs. To perform that standardization well, I analyzed annotated objects size and find out useful scale factors. Hence, small objects can still be detected and large objects are not cropped. \r\nNevertheless, such a standardization unbalances the images/class ratio. A naive idea to tackle this issue was to sub-sample the dataset.\r\nThus, this model was trained on a dataset containing (15 + 1) * 115 images extracted from the DOTA dataset.\r\nThe predictions were also made using the standardized set of test images.\r\nFinally, a simple non-maximum suppression algorithm was used to merge the predictions.",
