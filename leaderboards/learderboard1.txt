            "description": "Our network is a two-stage method based on Faster-RCNN. In the first stage, the feature map contains more feature information and less noise information by adding IF-Net and MDA-Net. Taking into account the positional sensitivity of the angle parameters, this stage still regresses the horizontal box. After the five-parameter regression and the rotation nonmaximum-suppression (R-NMS) operation for each proposal in the second stage, we get the final detection results. An end-to-end multi-category arbitrary rotation object detection algorithm is proposed for the complex aerial image. Considering the three factors of receptive field matching, feature fusion, and anchor sampling, a feature fusion network with smaller SA is added. At the same time, the algorithm weakens the influence of noise and highlights the object information through a multi-dimensional attention network with a sizeable receptive field.",

            "description": "Our network is a two-stage method based on Faster-RCNN. In the first stage, the feature map contains more feature information and less noise information by adding IF-Net and MDA-Net. Taking into account the positional sensitivity of the angle parameters, this stage still regresses the horizontal box. After the five-parameter regression and the rotation nonmaximum-suppression (R-NMS) operation for each proposal in the second stage, we get the final detection results. An end-to-end multi-category arbitrary rotation object detection algorithm is proposed for the complex aerial image. Considering the three factors of receptive field matching, feature fusion, and anchor sampling, a feature fusion network with smaller SA is added. At the same time, the algorithm weakens the influence of noise and highlights the object information through a multi-dimensional attention network with a sizeable receptive field. Moreover, we implement rotation detection to preserve orientation information and solve intensive problems.",

Region Proposed Networks can make use of rich angle information.In addition, some improvements have been made in feature mention. The base network extracts the image features first, and selects the fourth layer features for the shared features of Region Proposed Networks and Fast networks. It processes this layer features in two parts. One part is embedded in the global mechanism module to get more text information, the other part is embedded in the local mechanism to get more local location information. The result of the submission is that the model has trained three hundred thousand results.",

            "description": "Our network is a two-stage method based on Faster-RCNN. In the first stage, the feature map contains more feature information and less noise information by adding IF-Net and MDA-Net. Taking into account the positional sensitivity of the angle parameters, this stage still regresses the horizontal box. After the five-parameter regression and the rotation nonmaximum-suppression (R-NMS) operation for each proposal in the second stage, we get the final detection results. An end-to-end multi-category arbitrary rotation object detection algorithm is proposed for the complex aerial image. Considering the three factors of receptive field matching, feature fusion, and anchor sampling, a feature fusion network with smaller SA is added. At the same time, the algorithm weakens the influence of noise and highlights the object information through a multi-dimensional attention network with a sizeable receptive field. Moreover, we implement rotation detection to preserve orientation information and solve intensive problems.",

The geometric constraint loss is also added to make sure our prediction results are more similar to standard markings. The focal loss and class-aware sampling is used for the severe sample imbalance in the DOTA annotation. In the training stage, rotation data-augmentation and multi-scale training is adapted to enhance the robustness of our model. The post-processing includes quadrilateral NMS and vertexes mapping. With multi-scale testing, we can give accurate detection result with 5fps for 1024*1024 input images. The backend is Resnet101-FPN,VGG-FPN and ResNeXt101-FPN trained on imagenet.",

The framework is based on Faster R-CNN [1] architecture. R2CNN Description: First, we use the Region Proposal Network (RPN) to generate axis-aligned bounding boxes that enclose the objects with different orientations. Second, for each axis-aligned obj box proposed by RPN, we extract its pooled features with different pooled sizes and the concatenated features are used to simultaneously predict the obg/non-obj score, axis-aligned box and inclined minimum area box. At last, we use an inclined non-maximum suppression to get the detection results.",

The geometric constraint loss is also added to make sure our prediction results are more similar to standard markings. The focal loss and class-aware sampling is used for the severe sample imbalance in the DOTA annotation. In the training stage, rotation data-augmentation and multi-scale training is adapted to enhance the robustness of our model. The post-processing includes quadrilateral NMS and vertexes mapping. With multi-scale testing, we can give accurate detection result with 5fps for 1024*1024 input images. The backend is Resnet101-FPN,VGG-FPN and ResNeXt101-FPN trained on imagenet.",

            "description": "We design a one-stage quadrilateral detector based on YOLOv3.In addition to the horizon bounding box regression, we stimulate the method of Textbox++ for predict the relative position of four vertexes to the HBB using logistic regression. The geometric constraint loss is also added to make sure our prediction results are more similar to standard markings. The focal loss and class-aware sampling is used for the severe sample imbalance in the DOTA annotation. In the training stage, rotation data-augmentation and multi-scale training is adapted to enhance the robustness of our model. The post-processing includes quadrilateral NMS and vertexes mapping. With multi-scale testing, we can give accurate detection result with 5fps for 1024*1024 input images. The backend is Resnet101-FPN,VGG-FPN and ResNeXt101-FPN trained on imagenet.",

            "description": "We propose a novel Repair Feature Pyramid Network (RFPN) for detecting various-scale instances. A Receptive Field Expansion Block (RFEB) is designed to increase the receptive field size for high-level semantic features, then the refined features are passed through a Spatial-Refinement Module (SRM) to repair the spatial details of multi-scale objects in images before summation by the lateral connection. We adopt DetNet as our backbone network, which is a network modified on the basis of FPN. The improved backbone keeps the former 4 stages stay as original ResNet-50, while adding the stage5 and stage6 with the same spatial resolution as the fourth stage. Finally, an arbitrary single-scale image is put into the network, it will output five feature maps from different fusion layers at multiple scales for prediction. In the recent works, for an more in-depth study, researches on object detection have finely divided their views into the sub-problems of classification and localization respectively. Classification task requires the model to be invariant to various transformations while localization is more accurate if the model is transformation-sensitive. As we notice that scale variation influences both classification and localization, the model, on the one hand, has to be able to recognize the object at different scales, on the other hand, must adjust the bounding box accordingly. We therefore propose RFE block and SRM to partially address the contradictory problem.",

Due to the great difference in target size,we devided the targets into three sets. For smaller two sets, we use Panoptic Feature Pyramid Networks(CVPR2019)detector. In addition, we use LinkNet to conduct semantic segmentation for scene target, like basket-court ,tennis-court and baseball-court, then we use the results of segmentation to form the horizontal rectangle. Multi-scale detection is performed while testing by slide windows of different sizes,  and the detection results for all the patches are combined by NMS to generate the results of original images.\r\n\r\nTo make the best of the data, we do the following for the training data: \r\n1: We conduct class balance resampling, image rotation and enhance. \r\n2: We crop the images into multiple sizes for multi-scale training & testing, like 300x300,500x500,800x800. \r\n3: We set multiple specific aspect ratios based on the scale distribution of the training data to select the prior boxes.",
