Ltd. is the world\u2019s leading provider and operator of intelligent IOT solution. Referenced from the RoI Transformer algorithm, we proposed an improved cascade rcnn detector. We use Resnext101 with FPN as the backbone. Before training, we slice images by DOTA_devkit, and adopt data augmentation such as multi scale, flip and rotation. Besides, multi-scale training, multi-scale testing and model merging are also used in our method.[1] Cascade R-CNN: Deiving into High Quality Object Detection; [2] Feature Pyramid Networks for object Detection ;[3] Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition; [4] Learing RoI Transformer for Oriented Object Detection in Aerial Images; [5] Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks;",

In the RPN stage, a novel design is adopted so that it can effectively avoid the problem of missed detection of dense long targets caused by NMS. And by combining shallow feature maps, the RPN stage can effectively locate the position of dense targets in multiple directions. The R-CNN stage uses a design similar to R2CNN, changing its head to predict four corner points, which can simultaneously predict horizontal rectangles and polygons. During training, the training and validation sets are rotated by 90, 180, and 270 degrees, cropped into 1024 by 1024 slices, and multi-scale training is used. During the test, 1024-sized slices and multiple scales (1, 1/2) were also used. So what is the result?",

We use Retainet and FPN combined object detection framework. In order to improve the accuracy of multi-class object detection, an object detection method based on multi-layer space and location information for remote sensing satellite images is proposed, which is a new end-to-end training framework for remote sensing images. In order to solve the problem of multi angle in remote sensing image, we use the rotated region recommendation network. First, the basic network is used to extract features. In order to improve the representation ability of features, the extracted multi-layer features are processed with spatial and location information. To avoid the impact of batch size on the model, group standardization is used to calculate the mean and variance.",

On this basis, the characteristic pyramid network is used to make the network more sensitive to the scale information of multi-scale targets.

Finally, these nine values were used for calculation to convert the horizontal box into the rotation box.ori_ori_250k",

            "description": "Multi-class geospatial object detection of aerial remote sensing images have attracted more and more attention from researchers. We use Retainet and FPN combined object detection framework. In order to improve the accuracy of multi-class object detection, an object detection method based on multi-layer space and location information for remote sensing satellite images is proposed, which is a new end-to-end training framework for remote sensing images. In order to solve the problem of multi angle in remote sensing image, we use the rotated region recommendation network. First, the basic network is used to extract features. In order to improve the representation ability of features, the extracted multi-layer features are processed with spatial and location information. To avoid the impact of batch size on the model, group standardization is used to calculate the mean and variance.",

The pictures in the test set are cut into 1024 * 1024 small pictures. No additional data augmentation techniques were used. The rotated rectangle box label is obtained by finding the minimum circumscribed rectangle of the quadrilateral label in the training set. The basic learning rate of training is 0.0025, and the batch size is 2. Only one GPU was used in the training process, and 12 epochs were made. This is the basic version of rotating frame detection based on faster r-cnn. Except FPN, there is no additional trick.",

            "description": "Our network is a two-stage method based on Faster-RCNN. In the first stage, the feature map contains more feature information and less noise information by adding IF-Net and MDA-Net. Taking into account the positional sensitivity of the angle parameters, this stage still regresses the horizontal box. After the five-parameter regression and the rotation nonmaximum-suppression (R-NMS) operation for each proposal in the second stage, we get the final detection results. An end-to-end multi-category arbitrary rotation object detection algorithm is proposed for the complex aerial image. Considering the three factors of receptive field matching, feature fusion, and anchor sampling, a feature fusion network with smaller SA is added. At the same time, the algorithm weakens the influence of noise and highlights the object information through a multi-dimensional attention network with a sizeable receptive field. Moreover, we implement rotation detection to preserve orientation information and sol",

            "description": "Our network is a two-stage method based on Faster-RCNN. In the first stage, the feature map contains more feature information and less noise information by adding IF-Net and MDA-Net. Taking into account the positional sensitivity of the angle parameters, this stage still regresses the horizontal box. After the five-parameter regression and the rotation nonmaximum-suppression (R-NMS) operation for each proposal in the second stage, we get the final detection results. An end-to-end multi-category arbitrary rotation object detection algorithm is proposed for the complex aerial image. Considering the three factors of receptive field matching, feature fusion, and anchor sampling, a feature fusion network with smaller SA is added. At the same time, the algorithm weakens the influence of noise and highlights the object information through a multi-dimensional attention network with a sizeable receptive field. Moreover, we implement rotation detection to preserve orientation information and solve intensive problems.",

            "description": "First of all, thank you very much for your reading.Because there are many small and medium objects in the it, I try to add more text information and angle information to the candidate boxes, add angle information to each anchor for train. Region Proposed Networks can make use of rich angle information.In addition, some improvements have been made in feature mention. The base network extracts the image features first, and selects the fourth layer features for the shared features of Region Proposed Networks and Fast networks. It processes this layer features in two parts. One part is embedded in the global mechanism module to get more text information, the other part is embedded in the local mechanism to get more local location information. The result of the submission is that the model has trained three hundred thousand results.",

            "description": "Our network is a two-stage method based on Faster-RCNN. In the first stage, the feature map contains more feature information and less noise information by adding IF-Net and MDA-Net. Taking into account the positional sensitivity of the angle parameters, this stage still regresses the horizontal box. After the five-parameter regression and the rotation nonmaximum-suppression (R-NMS) operation for each proposal in the second stage, we get the final detection results. An end-to-end multi-category arbitrary rotation object detection algorithm is proposed for the complex aerial image. Considering the three factors of receptive field matching, feature fusion, and anchor sampling, a feature fusion network with smaller SA is added. At the same time, the algorithm weakens the influence of noise and highlights the object information through a multi-dimensional attention network with a sizeable receptive field. Moreover, we implement rotation detection to preserve orientation information and solve intensive problems.",

The geometric constraint loss is also added to make sure our prediction results are more similar to standard markings. The focal loss and class-aware sampling is used for the severe sample imbalance in the DOTA annotation. In the training stage, rotation data-augmentation and multi-scale training is adapted to enhance the robustness of our model. The post-processing includes quadrilateral NMS and vertexes mapping. With multi-scale testing, we can give accurate detection result with 5fps for 1024*1024 input images. The backend is Resnet101-FPN,VGG-FPN and ResNeXt101-FPN trained on imagenet.",

The framework is based on Faster R-CNN [1] architecture. R2CNN Description: First, we use the Region Proposal Network (RPN) to generate axis-aligned bounding boxes that enclose the objects with different orientations. Second, for each axis-aligned obj box proposed by RPN, we extract its pooled features with different pooled sizes and the concatenated features are used to simultaneously predict the obg/non-obj score, axis-aligned box and inclined minimum area box. At last, we use an inclined non-maximum suppression to get the detection results.",

The geometric constraint loss is also added to make sure our prediction results are more similar to standard markings. The focal loss and class-aware sampling is used for the severe sample imbalance in the DOTA annotation. In the training stage, rotation data-augmentation and multi-scale training is adapted to enhance the robustness of our model. The post-processing includes quadrilateral NMS and vertexes mapping. With multi-scale testing, we can give accurate detection result with 5fps for 1024*1024 input images. The backend is Resnet101-FPN,VGG-FPN and ResNeXt101-FPN trained on imagenet.",

The geometric constraint loss is also added to make sure our prediction results are more similar to standard markings. The focal loss and class-aware sampling is used for the severe sample imbalance in the DOTA annotation. In the training stage, rotation data-augmentation and multi-scale training is adapted to enhance the robustness of our model. The post-processing includes quadrilateral NMS and vertexes mapping. With multi-scale testing, we can give accurate detection result with 5fps for 1024*1024 input images. The backend is Resnet101-FPN,VGG-FPN and ResNeXt101-FPN trained on imagenet.",

            "description": "We propose a novel Repair Feature Pyramid Network (RFPN) for detecting various-scale instances. A Receptive Field Expansion Block (RFEB) is designed to increase the receptive field size for high-level semantic features, then the refined features are passed through a Spatial-Refinement Module (SRM) to repair the spatial details of multi-scale objects in images before summation by the lateral connection. We adopt DetNet as our backbone network, which is a network modified on the basis of FPN. The improved backbone keeps the former 4 stages stay as original ResNet-50, while adding the stage5 and stage6 with the same spatial resolution as the fourth stage. Finally, an arbitrary single-scale image is put into the network, it will output five feature maps from different fusion layers at multiple scales for prediction. In the recent works, for an more in-depth study, researches on object detection have finely divided their views into the sub-problems of classification and localization respectively. Classification task requires the model to be invariant to various transformations while localization is more accurate if the model is transformation-sensitive. As we notice that scale variation influences both classification and localization, the model, on the one hand, has to be able to recognize the object at different scales, on the other hand, must adjust the bounding box accordingly. We therefore propose RFE block and SRM to partially address the contradictory problem.",

We classify some categories in detail on the basis of the original 16 classes in consideration of the great difference in target size. For example, we divide the ship category into big ship and small ship, and we divide the harbor category into long harbor and short harbor etc. Inspired from the super resolution, we enlarge the small targets and reduce the large targets to enrich training samples and improve the robustness of our model. Due to the great difference in target size,we devided the targets into three sets. For smaller two sets, we use Panoptic Feature Pyramid Networks(CVPR2019)detector. In addition, we use LinkNet to conduct semantic segmentation for scene target, like basket-court ,tennis-court and baseball-court, then we use the results of segmentation to form the horizontal rectangle. Multi-scale detection is performed while testing by slide windows of different sizes,  and the detection results for all the patches are combined by NMS to generate the results of original images.\r\n\r\nTo make the best of the data, we do the following for the training data: \r\n1: We conduct class balance resampling, image rotation and enhance. \r\n2: We crop the images into multiple sizes for multi-scale training & testing, like 300x300,500x500,800x800. \r\n3: We set multiple specific aspect ratios based on the scale distribution of the training data to select the prior boxes.",

We used the resnet-50 as backbone of our network.\r\n\r\nTo focusing on our main problem, we have reduced 15 categories to 5 , which is our concern including large-vehicle, small-vehicle, helicopter, ship and plane.\r\n\r\nPre-trained model will shorten the training time, but the image-net data set is not fit for our business goal.  Considering the gap between the dataset, we trained our network from scratch and the model finally converged.\r\n\r\nWe would like to use the test set of the DOTA competition to evaluate our network.\r\nThank you!",

We use standard ROI Transformer as our base model, as defined by Jian Ding et al., 2018 and add FPN, as defined by Tsung-Yi Linet al., 2016. We used the resnet-50 as backbone of our network. To focusing on our main problem, we have reduced 15 categories to 5 , which is our concern including large-vehicle, small-vehicle, helicopter, ship and plane. Pre-trained model will shorten the training time, but the image-net data set is not fit for our business goal. Considering the gap between the dataset, we trained our network from scratch and the model finally converged. We would like to use the test set of the DOTA competition to evaluate our network.

            "description": "The name of the compressed package is Task2_merge_zp.zip. The compressed package contains 16 categories of txt files, and the format of each txt file content is: imgname score xmin ymin xmax ymax. I trained the yolov3 model under the pytorch framework, and the data set used DOTA_1.5. I reasoned about the test pictures in the DOTA_1.5 / test folder and got 16 categories of txt files. My purpose is to evaluate the results of my training on DOTA TASK2 and obtain evaluation indicators. I'm glad you can help me. Your data sets and toolkits have given me a lot of help. Thank you very much for your contributions and help people like me, so that we can learn and correct so easily. Once again express my sincere thanks and good luck to you!",
