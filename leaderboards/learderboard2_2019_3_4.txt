            "description": "We conducted multi-scale training and prediction for DOTA dataset. Our model is based on the Faster R-CNN network with the FPN structure. In data pre-processing, images and correspond ground truth data in DOTA dataset is first cropped according to a certain degree of overlap. Then, data augmentation (image rotation and flipping) is adopted. During the training process, the network randomly selects a certain scale and re-sizes the image to this scale. In the testing process, a patch-based multi-scale fusion policy was adopted. Experimental results show that the method is effective on the validation dataset. Our source code is based on Detectron framework (https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron).",

We introduce deformable convolution and dilate convolution in the basic model to make it more powerful in detecting small targets.During training, we set the scale of the input image to [1024,1024] and use warm-up strategy in the learning rate adjustment phase.During testing, we split all the test images into [1024,1024] and then merge the results by using post-possessing method: NMS.It is noticable that we use different nms threholds for different categories to get better results, and we call it :multi_nms.",

            "description": "These predictions have been made by a simple Faster-RCNN model with a classifier that predicts the whole 15 classes (not a one versus all method).\r\nThe dataset has been standardized so that each image has the same size as the others (512x512). Thus I can control model inputs. To perform that standardization well, I analyzed annotated objects size and find out useful scale factors. Hence, small objects can still be detected and large objects are not cropped. \r\nNevertheless, such a standardization unbalances the images/class ratio. A naive idea to tackle this issue was to sub-sample the dataset.\r\nThus, this model was trained on a dataset containing (15 + 1) * 115 images extracted from the DOTA dataset.\r\nThe predictions were also made using the standardized set of test images.\r\nFinally, a simple non-maximum suppression algorithm was used to merge the predictions.",

It is a cooperation work among TU Hannover Germany, TU Darmstadt Germany, and Twente University Nederland. \r\nWe proposed a new network dubbed as STDN which is specially and carefully designed for vehicle detection in area images. We have evaluated our method on several benchmark datasets. DOTA is the existing largest benchmark dataset in this field. It's necessary to evaluate our model on DATA and make it more convinced.",
