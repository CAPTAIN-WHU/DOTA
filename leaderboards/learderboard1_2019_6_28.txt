            "description": "The pipelines is based on MASK RCNN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870). We modified the architecture of the network for training, to be exact, we adopt RPN-FRCN-Mask concatenated architecture, instead of \u2018Fast RCNN head\u2019 & \u2018Mask head\u2019 paralleling structure. And we augmented the network as PANet does (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01534). Besides, we use some tricks for better performance, including class balance resampling, image rotation, multi-scale training & testing. ps: ex7_2_rpn-frcn-mask-multiscale_(700, 900, 1024, 1200, 1300)700, 900, 1024, 1200, 1300",

            "description": "First of all, thank you very much for your reading.Because there are many small and medium objects in the it, I try to add more text information and angle information to the candidate boxes, add angle information to each anchor for train. Region Proposed Networks can make use of rich angle information.In addition, some improvements have been made in feature mention. The base network extracts the image features first, and selects the fourth layer features for the shared features of Region Proposed Networks and Fast networks. It processes this layer features in two parts. One part is embedded in the global mechanism module to get more text information, the other part is embedded in the local mechanism to get more local location information. The result of the submission is that the model has trained three hundred thousand results.",

The geometric constraint loss is also added to make sure our prediction results are more similar to standard markings. The focal loss and class-aware sampling is used for the severe sample imbalance in the DOTA annotation. In the training stage, rotation data-augmentation and multi-scale training is adapted to enhance the robustness of our model. The post-processing includes quadrilateral NMS and vertexes mapping. With multi-scale testing, we can give accurate detection result with 5fps for 1024*1024 input images. The backend is Resnet101-FPN,VGG-FPN and ResNeXt101-FPN trained on imagenet.",
