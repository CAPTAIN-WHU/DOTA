            "description": "We adopt the idea of R2CNN[1] which adds oriented bounding boxes directly to the end of RPN, And the horizontal bounding boxes regression is also kept to monitor the training of oriented bounding boxes. To facilitate prediction of different scale of objects, we adopt FPN in the RPN with dense connection according to R-DFPN[2]. We use larger NMS bboxes per image and that per class in fast-rcnn to predict densely located objects like vehicles and ships.",
