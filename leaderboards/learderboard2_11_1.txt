            "description": "We conducted multi-scale training and prediction for DOTA dataset. Our model is based on the Faster R-CNN network with the FPN structure. In data pre-processing, images and correspond ground truth data in DOTA dataset is first cropped according to a certain degree of overlap. Then, data augmentation (image rotation and flipping) is adopted. During the training process, the network randomly selects a certain scale and re-sizes the image to this scale. In the testing process, a patch-based multi-scale fusion policy was adopted. Experimental results show that the method is effective on the validation dataset. Our source code is based on Detectron framework (https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron).",

The convolutional layer contains 13 conv layers, 13 relu layers, and 4 pooling layers. Faster R-CNN integrates algorithms such as selective search into the depth. In the network, this not only solves the problem that the algorithm such as selective search is cpu implementation, and the speed is slow, and it is combined with the deep network to share the previous convolution calculation, which is more efficient. . Tested at VOC2007 with a mAP of 67%, further adjustments are needed. I entered the test data after 70,000 iterations on the DOTA training set. In the test network, I set the threshold to 0.9, filtering out the lower bounding box, and the detection of small targets might be Not ideal.",

            "description": "These predictions have been made by a simple Faster-RCNN model with a classifier that predicts the whole 15 classes (not a one versus all method).\r\nThe dataset has been standardized so that each image has the same size as the others (512x512). Thus I can control model inputs. To perform that standardization well, I analyzed annotated objects size and find out useful scale factors. Hence, small objects can still be detected and large objects are not cropped. \r\nNevertheless, such a standardization unbalances the images/class ratio. A naive idea to tackle this issue was to sub-sample the dataset.\r\nThus, this model was trained on a dataset containing (15 + 1) * 115 images extracted from the DOTA dataset.\r\nThe predictions were also made using the standardized set of test images.\r\nFinally, a simple non-maximum suppression algorithm was used to merge the predictions.",
