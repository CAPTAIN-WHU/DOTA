We add semantic segmentation branch to RPN head, and utilize multi-stage FPN feature as well as semantic feature to enhance feature representation in RCNN head. Both in training and testing, we split the original images with 1024 and gap 512, and using DOTA_devkit to merge results when testing. We used multi-scale training&testing, and augmentations like flip and rotate when testing. We trained three models using ResNet101, ResneXt101 and ResNet101 mdcn version. The final result is ensemble version. [1] Lin T Y, Doll\u00e1r P, Girshick R B, et al. Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection[C]//CVPR. 2017, 1(2): 4. [2] Ren S, He K, Girshick R, et al.

            "description": "this is a submission with result of an original mask-rcnn model. the train set and val set are splited into 800*800 with 200 overlap and they are transformed into a coco dataset format. There might be some empty files--baseball diamond,basketball court,container crane, roundabout and soccer ball field. these are replaced with result from the last try. The model is trained under pytorch. Data of horizontal bounding boxes is not used however, in this task, label in task1 is used as training data as the mask and horizontal bounding boxes are extracted from masks.The result was reached with 50 epoches and 1000 images per step. there are some question about ResultMerge because too many objects in some txt.Let\u2019s see how this network work.",

            "description": "The test results we submit are generated with our detection network which use a novel one - stage detection struction and achieve good results in remote sensing image detection. We took the first-order hourglass network as our backbone network, and added four detectors to the backbone network to detect objects of different scales, and superimposed the features of different scales on the channels, that is, features of different scales were fused. In addition, we also use the feature enhancement network to prevent the feature information of small objects from gradually disappearing with the increase of network depth. Our method effectively improves the accuracy of target detection, but the detection speed is still in the leading level.The results of this submission is based on the model we have trained for 15,000 epochs.",
