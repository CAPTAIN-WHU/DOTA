            "description": "We conducted multi-scale training and prediction for DOTA dataset. Our model is based on the Faster R-CNN network with the FPN structure. In data pre-processing, images and correspond ground truth data in DOTA dataset is first cropped according to a certain degree of overlap. Then, data augmentation (image rotation and flipping) is adopted. During the training process, the network randomly selects a certain scale and re-sizes the image to this scale. In the testing process, a patch-based multi-scale fusion policy was adopted. Experimental results show that the method is effective on the validation dataset. Our source code is based on Detectron framework (https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron).",

Region Proposed Networks can make use of rich angle information.In addition, some improvements have been made in feature mention. The base network extracts the image features first, and selects the fourth layer features for the shared features of Region Proposed Networks and Fast networks. It processes this layer features in two parts. One part is embedded in the global mechanism module to get more text information, the other part is embedded in the local mechanism to get more local location information. The result of the submission is that the model has trained three hundred thousand results.",

            "description": "Over the last two decades, multiple classifier system (MCS) or classifier ensemble\r\nhas shown great potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of remote sensing image\r\nclassification. Although there are lots of literatures covering the MCS approaches, there\r\nis a lack of a comprehensive literature review which presents an overall architecture of\r\nthe basic principles and trends behind the design of remote sensing classifier ensemble.\r\nTherefore, in order to give a reference point for MCS approaches, this paper attempts to\r\nexplicitly review the remote sensing implementations of MCS and proposes some modified\r\napproaches. The effectiveness of existing and improved algorithms are analyzed and\r\nevaluated by multi-source remotely sensed images, including high spatial resolution image\r\n(QuickBird), hyperspectral image (OMISII) and multi-spectral image (Landsat ETM+).\r\nExperimental results demonstrate that MCS can effectively improve the accuracy and\r\nstability of remote sensing image classification, and diversity measures play an active role\r\nfor the combination of multiple classifiers. Furthermore, this survey provides a roadmap\r\nto guide future research, algorithm enhancement and facilitate knowledge accumulation of\r\nMCS in remote sensing community",

The geometric constraint loss is also added to make sure our prediction results are more similar to standard markings. The focal loss and class-aware sampling is used for the severe sample imbalance in the DOTA annotation. In the training stage, rotation data-augmentation and multi-scale training is adapted to enhance the robustness of our model. The post-processing includes quadrilateral NMS and vertexes mapping. With multi-scale testing, we can give accurate detection result with 5fps for 1024*1024 input images. The backend is Resnet101-FPN,VGG-FPN and ResNeXt101-FPN trained on imagenet.",

            "description": "Our network is a two-stage method based on Faster-RCNN. In the first stage, the feature map contains more feature information and less noise information by adding IF-Net and MDA-Net. Taking into account the positional sensitivity of the angle parameters, this stage still regresses the horizontal box. After the five-parameter regression and the rotation nonmaximum-suppression (R-NMS) operation for each proposal in the second stage, we get the final detection results. An end-to-end multi-category arbitrary rotation object detection algorithm is proposed for the complex aerial image. Considering the three factors of receptive field matching, feature fusion, and anchor sampling, a feature fusion network with smaller SA is added. At the same time, the algorithm weakens the influence of noise and highlights the object information through a multi-dimensional attention network with a sizeable receptive field. Moreover, we implement rotation detection to preserve orientation information and solve intensive problems.",

Due to the great difference between the targets in size, we devided them into three parts by size.\u00a0SSD is used for the two smaller parts, and LinkNet is used to conduct semantic segmentation for scene target, such as basketball-court, tennis-court and baseball-court. Then we generate the horizontal rectangles using the segmentation result. Multi-scale detection is performed while testing by sliding windows of different size, and the detection results for all the patches are combined by NMS to generate the final results.\r\n\r\nTo make the best of the data, we do the following for the training data:\u00a0\r\n1: We conduct class balance resampling, image rotation and enhance. \r\n2: We crop the images into multiple sizes for multi-scale training & testing, such as 300x300,500x500,800x800. \r\n3: We set multiple specific aspect ratios based on the scale distribution of the training data to select the prior boxes.\r\n\r\n[1] Deng, J, Dong, W, Socher, R, Li, L-J, Li, K, Fei-Fei, L.

            "description": "These predictions have been made by a simple Faster-RCNN model with a classifier that predicts the whole 15 classes (not a one versus all method).\r\nThe dataset has been standardized so that each image has the same size as the others (512x512). Thus I can control model inputs. To perform that standardization well, I analyzed annotated objects size and find out useful scale factors. Hence, small objects can still be detected and large objects are not cropped. \r\nNevertheless, such a standardization unbalances the images/class ratio. A naive idea to tackle this issue was to sub-sample the dataset.\r\nThus, this model was trained on a dataset containing (15 + 1) * 115 images extracted from the DOTA dataset.\r\nThe predictions were also made using the standardized set of test images.\r\nFinally, a simple non-maximum suppression algorithm was used to merge the predictions.",
