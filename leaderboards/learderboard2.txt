Ltd. is the world\u2019s leading provider and operator of intelligent IOT solution. Referenced from the RoI Transformer algorithm, we proposed an improved cascade rcnn detector. We use Resnext101 with FPN as the backbone. Before training, we slice images by DOTA_devkit, and adopt data augmentation such as multi scale, flip and rotation. Besides, multi-scale training, multi-scale testing and model merging are also used in our method.[1] Cascade R-CNN: Deiving into High Quality Object Detection; [2] Feature Pyramid Networks for object Detection ;[3] Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition; [4] Learing RoI Transformer for Oriented Object Detection in Aerial Images; [5] Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks;",

Ignore splitted boxes for which half of the box (0.5) gets cut off because of slicing. After testing, use DOTA_devkit to merge sliced images with detection results.\r\n\r\nData augmentation: Apply multi-scales. Ignore extreme small boxes produced by multi-scales because extreme small boxes hurt training. Apply rotations. \r\n\r\nModel: Faster-RCNN + FPN, with backbone of ResNext101+ dcn (deformable convolutional networks) applied on stem layer.\r\n\r\nTraining & Testing: Multi-scale training, and multi-scale testing with NMS afterwards. Warm up learning rate in the beginning and step learning rate twice.\r\n\r\nSource Code: MMdetection. The original MMdetection code suffers out of memory errors if an image has too many boxes. We can move tensors to CPU when computing overlaps between proposals and ground truth boxes, and move them back to GPU afterwards, with sacrifice of time. Or calculate overlaps in cython without time consuming.",

We use Retainet and FPN combined object detection framework. In order to improve the accuracy of multi-class object detection, an object detection method based on multi-layer space and location information for remote sensing satellite images is proposed, which is a new end-to-end training framework for remote sensing images. In order to solve the problem of multi angle in remote sensing image, we use the rotated region recommendation network. First, the basic network is used to extract features. In order to improve the representation ability of features, the extracted multi-layer features are processed with spatial and location information. To avoid the impact of batch size on the model, group standardization is used to calculate the mean and variance.",

Compared with anchor-based method, it can save the computing resources about anchor boxes. Besides, for improving the center point feature representation ability, the encoding-to-decoding structure be introduced. We fuse the multi-scale feature information by linking the deep features and shallow features.",

The pictures in the test set are cut into 1024 * 1024 small pictures. No additional data augmentation techniques were used. The rotated rectangle box label is obtained by finding the minimum circumscribed rectangle of the quadrilateral label in the training set. The basic learning rate of training is 0.0025, and the batch size is 2. Only one GPU was used in the training process, and 12 epochs were made. This is the basic version of rotating frame detection based on faster r-cnn. Except FPN, there is no additional trick.",

We will continue to update DOTA, to grow in size and scope and to reflect evolving real-world conditions. For the DOTA-v1.0, as described in the paper, it contains 2806 aerial images from different sensors and platforms. Each image is of the size in the range from about 800 \u00d7 800 to 4000 \u00d7 4000 pixels and contains objects exhibiting a wide variety of scales, orientations, and shapes. These DOTA images are then annotated by experts in aerial image interpretation using 15 common object categories.",

            "description": "First of all, thank you very much for your reading.Because there are many small and medium objects in the it, I try to add more text information and angle information to the candidate boxes, add angle information to each anchor for train. Region Proposed Networks can make use of rich angle information.In addition, some improvements have been made in feature mention. The base network extracts the image features first, and selects the fourth layer features for the shared features of Region Proposed Networks and Fast networks. It processes this layer features in two parts. One part is embedded in the global mechanism module to get more text information, the other part is embedded in the local mechanism to get more local location information. The result of the submission is that the model has trained three hundred thousand results.",

            "description": "In our design, we first split these training images to 1024*1024, and also change their corresponding labels .Then we use FPN as the basic detection model. We introduce deformable convolution and dilate convolution in the basic model to make it more powerful in detecting small targets.During training, we set the scale of the input image to [1024,1024] and use warm-up strategy in the learning rate adjustment phase.During testing, we split all the test images into [1024,1024] and then merge the results by using post-possessing method: NMS.It is noticable that we use different nms threholds for different categories to get better results, and we call it :multi_nms.",

            "description": "Over the last two decades, multiple classifier system (MCS) or classifier ensemble\r\nhas shown great potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of remote sensing image\r\nclassification. Although there are lots of literatures covering the MCS approaches, there\r\nis a lack of a comprehensive literature review which presents an overall architecture of\r\nthe basic principles and trends behind the design of remote sensing classifier ensemble.\r\nTherefore, in order to give a reference point for MCS approaches, this paper attempts to\r\nexplicitly review the remote sensing implementations of MCS and proposes some modified\r\napproaches. The effectiveness of existing and improved algorithms are analyzed and\r\nevaluated by multi-source remotely sensed images, including high spatial resolution image\r\n(QuickBird), hyperspectral image (OMISII) and multi-spectral image (Landsat ETM+).\r\nExperimental results demonstrate that MCS can effectively improve the accuracy and\r\nstability of remote sensing image classification, and diversity measures play an active role\r\nfor the combination of multiple classifiers. Furthermore, this survey provides a roadmap\r\nto guide future research, algorithm enhancement and facilitate knowledge accumulation of\r\nMCS in remote sensing community",

The geometric constraint loss is also added to make sure our prediction results are more similar to standard markings. The focal loss and class-aware sampling is used for the severe sample imbalance in the DOTA annotation. In the training stage, rotation data-augmentation and multi-scale training is adapted to enhance the robustness of our model. The post-processing includes quadrilateral NMS and vertexes mapping. With multi-scale testing, we can give accurate detection result with 5fps for 1024*1024 input images. The backend is Resnet101-FPN,VGG-FPN and ResNeXt101-FPN trained on imagenet.",

            "description": "The test results we submit are generated with our detection network which use a novel one - stage detection structure and achieve good results in remote sensing image detection. We took the two-order hourglass network as our backbone network, and added four detectors to the backbone network to detect objects of different scales, and superimposed the features of different scales on the channels, that is, features of different scales were fused. In addition, we also use the feature enhancement residual module to prevent the feature information of small objects from gradually disappearing with the increase of network depth. Our method effectively improves the accuracy of target detection, but the detection speed is still in the leading level.The results of this submission is based on the model we have trained.",

            "description": "Our network is a two-stage method based on Faster-RCNN. In the first stage, the feature map contains more feature information and less noise information by adding IF-Net and MDA-Net. Taking into account the positional sensitivity of the angle parameters, this stage still regresses the horizontal box. After the five-parameter regression and the rotation nonmaximum-suppression (R-NMS) operation for each proposal in the second stage, we get the final detection results. An end-to-end multi-category arbitrary rotation object detection algorithm is proposed for the complex aerial image. Considering the three factors of receptive field matching, feature fusion, and anchor sampling, a feature fusion network with smaller SA is added. At the same time, the algorithm weakens the influence of noise and highlights the object information through a multi-dimensional attention network with a sizeable receptive field. Moreover, we implement rotation detection to preserve orientation information and solve intensive problems.",

Due to the great difference between the targets in size, we devided them into three parts by size.\u00a0SSD is used for the two smaller parts, and LinkNet is used to conduct semantic segmentation for scene target, such as basketball-court, tennis-court and baseball-court. Then we generate the horizontal rectangles using the segmentation result. Multi-scale detection is performed while testing by sliding windows of different size, and the detection results for all the patches are combined by NMS to generate the final results.\r\n\r\nTo make the best of the data, we do the following for the training data:\u00a0\r\n1: We conduct class balance resampling, image rotation and enhance. \r\n2: We crop the images into multiple sizes for multi-scale training & testing, such as 300x300,500x500,800x800. \r\n3: We set multiple specific aspect ratios based on the scale distribution of the training data to select the prior boxes.\r\n\r\n[1] Deng, J, Dong, W, Socher, R, Li, L-J, Li, K, Fei-Fei, L.

In order to enable the model to detect targets of different sizes, this method uses 27 different anchors with 9 different sizes (32,96,128,192,384,512,768,1536,3072) and 3 scales (1:1, 1:2, 2:1). When training the data, the reverse sequence method is used to cut the pictures on the edge to make full use of the training data set. The same method is used when testing the data to reduce missed detections. When testing the data, the images are cut by overlapping between the pictures, missed detections caused by dividing the same target into two pictures are reduced in this way. For the initial detection results, the non_maximum suppression method with a threshold of 0.5 is used to screen the results and get the final result.",

            "description": "In object detection, an intersection over union (IoU) threshold is required to define positives and negatives. An object detector, trained with low IoU threshold, e.g. 0.5, usually produces noisy detections. However, detection performance tends to degrade with increasing the IoU thresholds. Two main factors are responsible for this: 1) overfitting during training, due to exponentially vanishing positive samples, and 2) inference-time mismatch between the IoUs for which the detector is optimal and those of the input hypotheses. A multi-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, is proposed to address these problems. It consists of a sequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, to be sequentially more selective against close false positives. The detectors are trained stage by stage, leveraging the observation that the output of a detector is a good distribution for training the next higher quality detector. The resampling of progressively improved hypotheses guarantees that all detectors have a positive set of examples of equivalent size, reducing the overfitting problem. The same cascade procedure is applied at inference, enabling a closer match between the hypotheses and the detector quality of each stage. A simple implementation of the Cascade R-CNN is shown to surpass all single-model object detectors on the challenging COCO dataset.",

Hence, small objects can still be detected and large objects are not cropped. \r\nNevertheless, such a standardization unbalances the images/class ratio. A naive idea to tackle this issue was to sub-sample the dataset.\r\nThus, this model was trained on a dataset containing (15 + 1) * 115 images extracted from the DOTA dataset.\r\nThe predictions were also made using the standardized set of test images.\r\nFinally, a simple non-maximum suppression algorithm was used to merge the predictions.",

The compressed package contains 16 categories of txt files, and the format of each txt file content is: imgname score xmin ymin xmax ymax. I trained the yolov3 model under the pytorch framework, and the data set used DOTA_1.5. I reasoned about the test pictures in the DOTA_1.5 / test folder and got 16 categories of txt files. My purpose is to evaluate the results of my training on DOTA TASK2 and obtain evaluation indicators. I'm glad you can help me. Your data sets and toolkits have given me a lot of help. Thank you very much for your contributions and help people like me, so that we can learn and correct so easily. Once again express my sincere thanks and good luck to you!",
