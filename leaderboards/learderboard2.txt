We introduce deformable convolution and dilate convolution in the basic model to make it more powerful in detecting small targets.During training, we set the scale of the input image to [1024,1024] and use warm-up strategy in the learning rate adjustment phase.During testing, we split all the test images into [1024,1024] and then merge the results by using post-possessing method: NMS.It is noticable that we use different nms threholds for different categories to get better results, and we call it :multi_nms.",
